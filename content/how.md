# Registration

Registration for IOL 2024 is made by representatives of accredited National Linguistics Olympiads, via IOL's Registration System. Each accredited country can participate with one or two teams, each team composed of 1 team leader (legally adult both in Brazil and in the country of origin) and 4 contestants (pre-university students, less than 20 years old on the first day of the competition, selected from an accredited National Olympiad). Additionally, the delegations can bring additional adult Observers at request.

**The registration will open and registration fees will be declared on January 26th, 2024.**

**Early Bird Registration will be from January 26th to February 26th.**

## Working languages

At IOL, we consider that all participants have the right to solve the problems in their own native language (or one of them). The problems are composed in parallel in all working languages, in a way that *all language versions are equal* – meaning that no participant has advantages in solving the problems in any particular language.

However, because the multilingual composition is a lengthy and complex process, we need the Delegations to inform us in advance about the possible working languages for your Delegation.

You have to inform your possible working languages by **February 12th, 2024**.

Please, do keep in mind that the choice of a working language is an iterative process. As soon as the selection is finished and you know that a certain working language will not be needed in 2024, *please contact us as soon as possible to withdraw the language*, so the Problem Committee can stop working on its version.

According to the Rules for participants, a competitor can change their language choice up to two weeks before the Olympiad begins, but only being able to choose from the languages in the final list of working languages.
